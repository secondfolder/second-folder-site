Being both nerdy and kinky it's always particularly fun finding things that intersect the two. One such thing is making a spreadsheet for tracking kinks. There are plenty great websites that let you compare your kinks with someone else to find which ones match but I wanted my own that I could customise as much as I liked. So a few years ago I started compiling my own.

For anyone interested it's available as a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tQa9iW7alvk9QjIk-UjqWn6OmN9GMpQh2ZXaKZYvYDI/edit) which you can copy if you want to enter in your own interests. But if you just want to have a play around with it I made a [demo version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GLj2Waoq57p5hQTbWdyKvBepzfx6OQuP9nfpVbzwJSc/edit) with fake answers already entered. Check the "Rank" tabs at the bottom to see how two peoples answers compare :)

Most of the entries are built off various other people's lists from the internet and from friends. I wish I kept records of who I based mine off so I could properly cite them here. However one interesting thing I noticed when making it is that a lots of the lists seemed to have suspiciously similar sections, with very particular wording and ordering of things matching across different lists. Even sometimes matching typos between to unrelated lists. So I suspect that's how a lot of existing kink lists have been made anyway, remixed from others lists.

I've modified this one a bit over the years and there's still a bunch of things I could do. It's definitely starting to push the limits of what you can comfortably do with a spreadsheet. Using it on a phone is a bit of a pain for instance. So someday I might make it into a webapp. But for now I'm pretty happy to keep it as is.
