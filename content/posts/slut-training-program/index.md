A few years ago as part of exploring an ownership and slut training dynamic I when looking around the internet for in a training guide/plan/program to use. Not so much as something to follow to the letter but more as a fun thing to loosely build the dynamic around. I didn't really come across anything that fit quite what I was looking for so I developed my own. I spend way too much time on it and in the end it never really got used so I thought I may as well put it out there for anyone.

Looking back now it's a bit cringe. There's definitely things I'd change if I was to re-write it today but I think there are still some good ideas in it and I think it could be a useful prompt for anyone making their own if nothing else. It's available as a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AxLNi-ZHRgJp-sE4nhke4997a1FxlbxwI2UCr0os_14/edit) which you can view, copy and modify however you like.
